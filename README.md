# 🌍 Terranova

A civilization-building RTS/economy simulation spanning from the Stone Age to the far future. Built with Unity.

> *Guide your people through the ages on a living, voxel-based world.*

## Vision

Terranova combines epoch-based civilization progression (inspired by Empire Earth) with voxel terrain and biomes (inspired by Minecraft) and deep economic simulation (inspired by Anno/Settlers). Every playthrough unfolds on a unique, procedurally generated world where your decisions shape the landscape across millennia.
